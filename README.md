# The Purloined Letter

### What is this project about?
Lacan attempted to provide a model to conceptualize the autonomous function of language in the unconscious and the incredible "indestructibility" of unconscious content. These models were first introduced in his seminar from 1954-55, titled *The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis*, and were greatly expanded upon in the postscript of his seminar on *The Stolen Letter* (Écrits 1966). In this project, the system presented by Lacan in *In The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis* offers a set of grammar—a set of rules or laws—not inherent in the "pre-existing reality." Thus, the possibilities and impossibilities arising from this can be viewed as stemming from the way the symbolic matrix is constructed, specifically in how it encodes events. In this particular case, it is not so much the fact of deciphering that produces the rules that "were never there," but rather the method of deciphering itself that generates these syntactical rules.
